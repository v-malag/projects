Zürich or Zurich (/ˈzjʊərɪk/ ZEWR-ik; see below for other names) is the largest city in Switzerland and the capital of the canton of Zürich. It is located in north-central Switzerland[4] at the northwestern tip of Lake Zürich. The municipality has approximately 430,000 inhabitants, the urban area (agglomeration) 1.315 million[5] and the Zürich metropolitan area 1.83 million.[6] Zürich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.

Permanently settled for over 2,000 years, Zürich was founded by the Romans, who, in 15 BC, called it Turicum. However, early settlements have been found dating back more than 6,400 years (although this only indicates human presence in the area and not the presence of a town that early). [7] During the Middle Ages, Zürich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli.[8]

The official language of Zürich is German,[a] but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Zürich German.

Many museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum, the Kunsthaus and newer Theater 11 in Oerlikon. Schauspielhaus Zürich is one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.[9]

Zürich is a leading global city and among the world's largest financial centres despite having a relatively small population.[10] The city is home to many financial institutions and banking companies. Many of Switzerland's research and development centres are concentrated in the Greater Zürich area and the low tax rates and canton funding subsidies attract overseas companies to set up their headquarters or finance treasury services in the city.[citation needed]

Monocle's 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Zürich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within".[11] In 2019 Zürich was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Geneva and Basel.[12]
